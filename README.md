Movie-Rent-web-site

Dummy site for movie rentals. The site has a registration system with identification of existing users.
There are two users - a regular user who can "rent a movie" and a manager user who has his own system that allows you to enter movies, 
delete or update them on the site including user information and delay after rentals. The site is aesthetically designed.
The system was written in C# using ASP.NET - MVC5 and Bootstrap. 
The database is with entity framworks and i used MSSQL - the project dont work without the proper DB bulid. 
If you need the DB file please contect me.
